This application allows you to create simple HMIs!
As for now, only SiemensS7 protocol and Modbus TCP are implemented.

When all the Basic HMI Features are implemented, a wiki will be added.

This project requires at least Java 11 to work. I've choosen that specific release since is the last one 32 bit release for Raspian (Now RaspberryPI OS) but this might change in future since now everything is 64 bit (urray)

This is a project developed in my free time and you feel supporting this project, you can always buy me a slice of pizza üçï
