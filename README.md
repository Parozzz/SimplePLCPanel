This application allows you to create simple HMIs!
As for now, only SiemensS7 protocol and Modbus TCP are implemented.

When all the Basic HMI Features are implemented, a wiki will be added.

This is a project developed in my free time and you feel supporting this project, you can always buy me a slice of pizza üçï
